	// Execute a statement or group of statement multiple times.
	//Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.
	//There are three types of loop
	//1) for loop 
	//2) while loop 
	//3) do-while loop
	//for loop: When the number of iteration is fixed, it is recommended to use for loop.
	//while loop: When the number of iteration is not fixed, it is recommended to use while loop.
	//do-while loop: When the number of iteration is not fixed and you need to execute the loop at least once, it is recommended to use the do-while loop.
	
	//Concept:
	//System.out.println("Let me go");
	//System.out.println("Let me go");
	//System.out.println("Let me go");
	//System.out.println("Let me go");
	//System.out.println("Let me go");
	//System.out.println("Let me go");
	//System.out.println("Let me go");
	//System.out.println("Let me go");
	//System.out.println("Let me go");
